To run from source run NetworkServer with a parameter for port.

``java NetworkServer 3000``

Then run the client

``java TagGame``

Enter a name, host (address or name), and port.

If you want to build the jars download the src.
Go to build folder.
Using Ant, run each xml and it'll build the respective jar files.

If the server is up you can connect your client to the following

host: sandbox.ethereallab.app

port: 3333

Though it requires a minimum of two players to actually do anything other than move.


Movement uses the arrow keys, gray players can only run, black players can tag other players with the space bar.
